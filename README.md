# For-PS4
This repo contains code for Newton's method from assignment 1, which is based on the question in Intro to Julia.

Since we're doing tongue twisters:

Betty Botter bought some butter
But she said the butter’s bitter
If I put it in my batter, it will make my batter bitter
But a bit of better butter will make my batter better
So ‘twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter
